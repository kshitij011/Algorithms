//recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem
//recursion is when the function calls itself

// Why we need recursion?
// recursion is a great technique to simplify our solution
//If you find yourself breaking down a problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.
